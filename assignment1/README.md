## How To Run Our Project?
java -jar LocalApplication.jar inputFileName1... inputFileNameN outputFileName1... outputFileNameN n [terminate]
- inputFileNameI is the name of the input file I.
- outputFileName is the name of the output file.
- n is the workersâ€™ files ratio (reviews per worker).
- terminate indicates that the application should terminate the manager at the end (optional).

## How The Program Works?

### Local Application
The application resides on a local (non-cloud) machine. Once started, it reads the input file from the user, and:
- Checks if a Manager node is active on the EC2 cloud. If it is not, the application will start the manager node.
- Uploads the file to S3.
- Sends a message to an SQS queue, stating the location of the file on S3
- Checks an SQS queue for a message indicating the process is done and the response (the summary file) is available on S3.
- Downloads the summary file from S3, and create an html file representing the results.
- In case of terminate mode (as defined by the command-line argument), sends a termination message to the Manager.

### The Manager
The manager process resides on an EC2 node. It checks a special SQS queue for messages from local applications. Once it receives a message it:
- **In the case of new task message**:
- Download the input file from S3.
- Distribute the operations to be performed on the reviews to the workers using SQS queue/s.
- Check the SQS message count and starts Worker processes (nodes) accordingly.
    - The manager should create a worker for every n messages (as defined by the command-line argument), if there are no running workers.
    - If there are k active workers, and the new job requires m workers, then the manager should create m-k new workers, if possible.
    - Note that while the manager creates a node for every n messages, it does not delegate messages to specific nodes. All of the worker nodes take their messages from the same SQS queue; so it might be the case that with 2n messages, hence two worker nodes, one node processed n+(n/2) messages, while the other processed only n/2.

- **In case the manger receives response messages from the workers (regarding input file), it:**
- Creates a summary output file accordingly,
- Uploads the output file to S3,
- Sends a message to the application with the location of the file.
- **In case of a termination message, the manager:**
- Should not accept any more input files from local applications. However, it does serve the local application that sent the termination message.
- Waits for all the workers to finish their job, and then terminates them.
- Creates response messages for the jobs, if needed.
- Terminates.

### The Workers
A worker process resides on an EC2 node. His life cycle:
Repeatedly:
- Get a message from an SQS queue.
- Perform the requested job, and return the result.
- Remove the processed message from the SQS queue.

### The Flow
1. The LocalApplication uploads the input files to S3 and sends a SQS message to the Manager indicating the information for downloading the uploaded files.
2. The Manager downloads the files from S3, and distributes sentiment analysis and entity extraction tasks to the Workers using SQS.
3. The Worker performs the sentiment analysis and entity extraction tasks, and sends the output back to the Manager using SQS.
4. The Manager collects all the outputs from the Workers and create a summary for each input file, uploads the content of the summary to S3 and sends a SQS message back to the LocalApplication indicating the information for downloading the uploaded content.
5. The LocalApplication downloads the summary from S3, and creates an HTML file. If the LocalApplication got terminate as an argument it sends terminate message to the Manager.

### More Detailed Flow
1. Local Application uploads the file with the list of reviews urls to S3.
2. Local Application sends a message (queue) stating the location of the input file on S3.
3. Local Application checks if a manager is active and if not, starts it.
4. Manager downloads a list of reviews.
5. Manager distributes sentiment analysis and entity extraction jobs on the workers.
6. Manager bootstraps nodes to process messages.
7. Worker gets a message from a SQS queue.
8. Worker performs the requested job/s on the review.
9. Worker puts a message in a SQS queue indicating the original reviewtogether with the output of the operation performed (sentiment/extracted entities).
10. Manager reads all Workers' messages from SQS and creates one summary file.
11. Manager uploads the summary file to S3.
12. Manager posts a SQS message about the summary file.
13. Local Application reads SQS message.
14. Local Application downloads the summary file from S3.
15. Local Application creates html output file.
16. Local application send a terminate message to the manager if it received <i>terminate</i> as one of its arguments.

### What type of instance did we used?
- ami-0a92c388d914cf40c
- types: T2.MICRO for the Manager and T2.MEDIUM for the Workers.

### How much time it took your program to finish working on the input files, and what was the n you used?
- About 10 minuts, 5 input files and n=49
